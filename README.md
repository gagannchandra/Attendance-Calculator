****Why this Program is Useful:****

This program is designed to help students keep track of their attendance percentage and assess the impact of future leaves on their attendance. Many institutions have strict attendance requirements, and students need to ensure they stay above a certain percentage to avoid academic penalties. This tool provides a quick way to calculate:

**Current Attendance Percentage:** Helps you see your current status based on total lectures, absences, and authorized absences (such as medical leave).
Impact of Future Leaves: By inputting how many days you plan to take off, the program recalculates your attendance percentage to help you determine whether taking additional leaves would drop your attendance below the required level.
Instructions for Using the Program:
Start the Program: The program will prompt you to enter data through simple questions.

**Input Data for Current Attendance:**

**Total Lectures:** Enter the total number of lectures that have been conducted so far.
**Total Absences:** Enter the total number of classes you've missed (unexcused absences).
**Other Authorized Absences (OAA):** Enter the total number of absences that are excused (such as medical leave or other valid reasons). These do not affect your attendance negatively.
**View Current Attendance:** The program will calculate and display your current attendance percentage.

**Option to Calculate Attendance After a Planned Leave:
**
The program will ask if you want to simulate the effect of taking a future leave. If you choose "Yes", you can enter the number of days you want to take leave for.
The program assumes 8 lectures per day, calculates how many additional lectures you'll miss, and then provides your new projected attendance percentage.
**Finish the Program**: After calculating the attendance (current and/or projected), the program will thank you for using it.

**Example Use Case:**
If you've attended 100 lectures so far, missed 10, and have 2 authorized absences (OAA), you will see your current attendance percentage.
If you then decide to take 3 more days off, the program will calculate how this leave impacts your attendance and whether it remains above your institutionâ€™s required threshold.
This tool simplifies attendance tracking, helping you make informed decisions about taking additional leave.
